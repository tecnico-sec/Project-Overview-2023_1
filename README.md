# Special Season Project Overview

This document describes the requirements for project for the Network and Computer Security / Segurança Informática em Redes e Sistemas (SIRS) course for the Special Evaluation Season.

The project is done by a **single student**.

## 1. Calendar

The **special season** begins officially on Monday, July 24st, 2023.
However, we recommend that you request the **project statement** earlier, starting: **Monday, July 3rd, 2023**.

To make the request, send an e-mail to [meic-sirs@disciplinas.tecnico.ulisboa.pt](mailto:meic-sirs@disciplinas.tecnico.ulisboa.pt) with the subject `SIRS EE inscr proj ist12345` with your IST identifier instead of 12345.
The body of the e-mail should contain the topic proposals (more details follow).

The project delivery is on: **Friday, July 21st, 2023, 12:00** (noon).
The project discussions will be done in the afternoon of the same day.

The special season exam is on Monday, July 24th, 2023.
The special season concludes on July 28th, 2023.

## 2. Proposal

The project proposal e-mail, mentioned above, must contain **two** distinct **topic proposals**.

The topics can be chosen for past SIRS project topics or self-proposed by the student.

Each project proposal should describe the problem and the proposed solution in around 100 words each.  

The project will be expected to have:

- a virtual machine running an application server chosen by the student, with firewall configurations to allow only authorized communications;
- a secure communication channel based on TLS or SSH to access server, with correct configuration of keys and certificates;
- the design and implementation of a custom cryptographic protocol, using primitive functions such as ciphers and hash functions.

Alternatively, the student can propose a more **exploratory topic**, in the broad area of interest covered by the course.  
For example: an in-depth analysis and demonstration of a recent attack, or the exploration and demonstration of new security tools, libraries, and standards in action.

## 3. Approval

The proposal will to be selected, modified and approved by the course faculty.
After the e-mail with the proposals is received and analyzed, a short meeting will be scheduled to settle and oficialize the topic.

## 4. Discussion

Each student will have to prepare a presentation and demonstration of the work.
The recommended duration is 5 minutes for presentation, and 10 minutes for demonstration with discussion.

The presentation slides are expected to describe:

- the solution architecture;
- the existing keys and how they are distributed;
- the custom cryptographic protocol in detail.

## 5. Final remarks

The special season project will allow you to explore and learn a specific topic, in-depth.
Make the most of the learning experience and ask for our feedback as much as possible.

If changes are made to this document, they can be viewed in the _Git Commit History_.
